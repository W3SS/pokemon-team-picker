Welcome to "Battling Data with GraphQL & React" Dev Academy Course
---

### Please Start With Day 01
* Day 01 https://intro-to-graphql.ryanyogan.com

### Running The Application

* Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:ryanyogan/pokemon-team-picker.git`
* `cd pokemon-team-picker && git fetch --all && git checkout DAY-01-START && yarn install`
* `yarn start`

### This is your space!
I have left this README intentionally blank as I want you to use this as a scratch pad throughout the course.

Please take your current work at the end of the day, and push it up to your github repo!  During the classes first day
I will show everyone how to save yourself with some git shortcuts, and best practices incase you end up down Alice's Rabbit Hole!

After each day, I would like you to follow a template such as this:

What did I learn today?
* What in the heck is GraphQL?
* What the render prop pattern is, and how it helps control flow.
* That REST was never a spec!
* Yogan just cannot seem to get onboard with Pokemon names!

What am I going to add to the app?
* I am going to add a small feature to show more information for each Pokemon
* A nice to have would be to Authenticate with Github, hmmm did Ryan show us where to learn how to do this? Yeaup!
* Bring everyone breakfast burritios FTW!

What do I feel stuck on?
* I am having trouble understanding why everything comes back as `data: { }` can I change this?
* My Team is loading slow, I want to load it when the user hovers over the Navigation link! HOW?!?!
```

```
DAY-02 - Ryan Yogan

What did I learn today?
* Everything!
* I now understand how to change the `data: {} ` props!

What am I going to add to the app?
* I am going to learn about Zeit's NOW and deploy the app to my own server :)

What do I feel stuck on?
* I can't decide on what color theme I want for my terminal
```


I will be looking through these at night, making sure everyone is getting the most out of their time, so please try and 
take a few minute to really put thought into these README updates.
